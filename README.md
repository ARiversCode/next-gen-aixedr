# next-gen-aixedr
The next generation of AI integrated Extended Endpoint Detection and Response

# Welcome to next-gen-aixedr! ðŸš€
>> DISCLAIMER: THIS DOESNT ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING DON'T USE THIS

This project is a cutting-edge experiment in developing an AI-driven, extensible, and automated tool that helps identify and resolve security risks across containerized environments and CI/CD pipelines. The goal here is to take the automation we love in CI/CD and the flexibility of containers, and supercharge them with AI-powered security insights.

# Project Overview
next-gen-aixedr focuses on integrating AI models to analyze containerized infrastructures (think Docker, Kubernetes) and CI/CD processes, identifying vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential risks. It aims to provide actionable recommendations to enhance security and efficiency across environments.

Key Features:
Container Security Auditing: Automatically audit Docker containers for misconfigurations, outdated dependencies, and vulnerabilities.
CI/CD Pipeline Monitoring: Real-time analysis of your CI/CD pipeline to detect any weak spots in the deployment process.
AI-Powered Insights: Leverages machine learning models to suggest optimized security configurations based on industry best practices.
Extensible Framework: Easily integrate new tools and security checks into the pipeline.
Automated Reports: Get detailed security reports and remediation steps for any identified risks.
Getting Started
Hereâ€™s a quick guide to get the project up and running in your environment.

# Prerequisites
To run next-gen-aixedr, youâ€™ll need the following tools installed:

Docker - We rely on containers for this project.
Python 3.8+ - For running the AI models and scripts.
Git - For version control.
(Optional) A CI/CD tool like GitLab or Jenkins for pipeline integration.

# Installation
Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/next-gen-aixedr.git
```
# Set Up the Environment

Navigate into the project directory:
```
cd next-gen-aixedr
```

Then, build the Docker container:

```bash

docker-compose build
```
# Run the Project

Once the build completes, you can run next-gen-aixedr using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
# View Reports

The tool will generate a security report upon completion. The report will be available in the /reports directory of the project.

To view the report:

```bash
cat reports/latest_report.txt
```
# Usage
To use next-gen-aixedr, simply integrate it into your existing CI/CD pipeline by adding it as a step in your deployment process. The tool will automatically audit the environment, report vulnerabilities, and provide recommendations.

Hereâ€™s an example integration with a GitLab pipeline:

```yaml
stages:
  - security

audit-containers:
  stage: security
  script:
    - docker-compose up --abort-on-container-exit
```
# Contributing
This project is still in its early stages, and contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the tool or want to add additional security checks, feel free to submit a pull request.

Fork the repo.
Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-branch).
Make your changes and commit them (git commit -m 'Add new feature').
Push to your branch (git push origin feature-branch).

Roadmap
 Implement deeper Kubernetes support.
 Add integration for other CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, CircleCI).
 Train models on more diverse datasets to improve AI recommendations.
 Build a web dashboard for viewing real-time analysis results.
